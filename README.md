## Thanks for reading! 

- another big note I suffer from Misanthropy, and I do have empathy but a lot more apathy.
- Misanthropy means: Misanthropy is the general hatred, dislike, or distrust of the human species, human behavior, or human nature. A misanthrope or misanthropist is someone who holds such views or feelings. Misanthropy involves a negative evaluative attitude toward humanity that is based on humankind's flaws.
- this stems from sexual abuse trama in my past and the fact that i had been friends with forceful religious people.
